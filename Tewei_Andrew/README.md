In this project, our goal is to design a pavilion with a basic architectural responsive system that aims to adapt the environmental conditions of the site. One of our major areas of interest is the lighting or solar radiation, which is a crucial element to consider when designing in an open area with no shades. In order to respond to this condition, the overall structure of our pavilion and the apertures within the panels installed that face directly on the sun path are partially closed to make sure that there are different amounts of lights shedding into the interiors of our pavilion. For the site of our pavilion, we have decided to pick the sloped grassland next to the tennis court because a lot of people use the area to relax or gather with friends, meaning that building a pavilion there would have the potential to provide them a space with multifunctional purposes of meeting space where people can convene and relaxation space where people can take rests. 

**Contents**

- `.pdf` of M6 submission
- additional `.gifs` or animated content
- `.gh` script file
- `.3dm` CAD model file
- this `.md` README

## Instructions for Use

This project uses a _Grasshopper_ script&mdash; which is a file that contains the algorithm to generatively design our spaceframe. You must have Rhino 7 to open the `.3dm` file.

**Dependencies**

The _Grasshopper_ script uses:
  - Lunchbox
  - Pufferfish

Install these dependencies and then open the `.gh` file in Rhino3D.
